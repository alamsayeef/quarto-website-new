I’m a doctoral candidate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, where my research focuses on statistical genetics and gastrointestinal diseases. With a strong foundation in statistics and biostatistics, I work with real-world health data to support better decision-making in healthcare.

My work involves applying advanced statistical methods and programming in R, Python, and bash. I also enjoy building interactive tools—such as Shiny apps—that help make complex data more accessible and actionable. I’m especially motivated by the opportunity to use programming to address real-world challenges in healthcare.

What motivates me most is the opportunity to apply programming and analytics to real-world challenges in healthcare. I find it rewarding to contribute to projects that have practical impact, whether through research, collaboration, or tool development.

Beyond research, I value community and connection. During the month of Ramadan, I volunteer at the MSiT mosque in Trondheim, helping serve food to people of all faiths—whether they are breaking their fast or simply sharing a warm meal with friends. It’s a small way to contribute to a welcoming and inclusive environment.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, swimming, improving my Norwegian and cooking for others. These activities help me stay grounded and bring balance to my academic life. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact.
