I am a final-year PhD candidate in Genetic Epidemiology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. My research focuses on statistical genetics and gastrointestinal diseases, where I analyze high-dimensional genetic data and link it with real-world health records to uncover differences across population groups.

I hold dual master’s degrees in Biostatistics and a bachelor’s degree in Statistics. Over the past six years, I have gained experience working with diverse health-related datasets, applying a range of statistical methods in epidemiology, biostatistics, clinical trials, and genetics.

I have hands-on experience with tools such as R, STATA, SAS, Excel (including VBA), and Bash. I particularly enjoy building interactive applications using Shiny to support data-driven decision-making. I am technically minded and strive to communicate complex ideas in a way that is accessible to different audiences. I value a positive working environment and am always open to new challenges. I am fluent in English and still learning Norwegian.

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, skiing, and watching anime. I’m also learning to swim. Community and connection are important to me—I volunteer at the MSiT mosque in Trondheim during Ramadan, helping serve meals to people of all backgrounds.

My career goal is to contribute to evidence synthesis and informed decision-making in healthcare through rigorous research, thoughtful analytics, and collaborative science that benefits communities worldwide.

**See ya later ⛷️**
