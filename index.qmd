::: center-about
I am a doctoral candidate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, with a strong background in health data analysis. My research focuses on statistical genetics and gastrointestinal diseases, where I work with tools like R, Python, and Bash.

In my spare time, I enjoy creating visualizations and building interactive applications to support decision-making in healthcare, and I'm driven by the chance to use programming to address challenges in healthcare using real-world data.
