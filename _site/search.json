With a strong foundation in statistics and biostatistics, I work with real-world health data to support better decision-making in healthcare.\nMy work involves applying advanced statistical methods and programming in R, Python, and bash. I also enjoy building interactive tools—such as Shiny apps—that help make complex data more accessible and actionable. I’m especially motivated by the opportunity to use programming to address real-world challenges in healthcare.\nWhat motivates me most is the opportunity to apply programming and analytics to real-world challenges in healthcare. I find it rewarding to contribute to projects that have practical impact, whether through research, collaboration, or tool development.\nBeyond research, I value community and connection. During the month of Ramadan, I volunteer at the MSiT mosque in Trondheim, helping serve food to people of all faiths—whether they are breaking their fast or simply sharing a warm meal with friends. It’s a small way to contribute to a welcoming and inclusive environment.\nOutside of work, I enjoy hiking, swimming, improving my Norwegian and cooking for others. These activities help me stay grounded and bring balance to my academic life. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact.\n\n\n\nSee ya later ⛷️"

You can check that by\ngit branch\nPush your code:\ngit push -u origin master\nHere the -u parameter means upstream so next time you can just write git push and it will remember that you wish to push it to master.
