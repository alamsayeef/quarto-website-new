    "text": "I am a final-year PhD candidate in Genetic Epidemiology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. My research focuses on statistical genetics and gastrointestinal diseases, where I analyze high-dimensional genetic data and link it with real-world health records to uncover differences across population groups.\nI hold dual master’s degrees in Biostatistics and a bachelor’s degree in Statistics. Over the past six years, I have gained experience working with diverse health-related datasets, applying a range of statistical methods in epidemiology, biostatistics, clinical trials, and genetics.\nI have hands-on experience with tools such as R, STATA, SAS, Excel (including VBA), and Bash. I particularly enjoy building interactive applications using Shiny to support data-driven decision-making. I am technically minded and strive to communicate complex ideas in a way that is accessible to different audiences. I value a positive working environment and am always open to new challenges. I am fluent in English and still learning Norwegian.\nOutside of research, I enjoy hiking, skiing, and watching anime. I’m also learning to swim. Community and connection are important to me—I volunteer at the MSiT mosque in Trondheim during Ramadan, helping serve meals to people of all backgrounds.\nMy career goal is to contribute to evidence synthesis and informed decision-making in healthcare through rigorous research, thoughtful analytics, and collaborative science that benefits communities worldwide.\nSee ya later ⛷️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The MOON (Modeling Obesity in Norway) study is a comprehensive decision-analytic model designed to simulate the long-term health and economic impacts of obesity in the Norwegian population. Built using a Markov framework, the model tracks individuals from age 2 to 100 across health states—normal weight, overweight, obese grade 1, obese grade 2, and death—based on real-world longitudinal data from national health surveys and registries. It estimates prevalence, healthcare costs, and years of life lost due to obesity, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of preventive and treatment interventions.\n\n\nWe are currently undertaking a modernization of the MOON model by transitioning it from its original Excel-based implementation to a more scalable and transparent R-based framework. This shift will involve re-coding the model logic, integrating statistical analyses directly within R, and improving the reproducibility and flexibility of simulations. By leveraging R’s capabilities in data handling, visualization, and probabilistic modeling, we aim to enhance the model’s usability for researchers, policymakers, and public health analysts.\nMigrating the MOON model to R will significantly improve its accessibility, adaptability, and analytical power. The new version will allow for easier updates with new data, more sophisticated scenario analyses, and integration with other public health datasets. It will also enable other researchers—both within and outside Norway—to replicate, calibrate, and extend the model to their own contexts. Ultimately, this upgrade will support more informed decision-making in obesity prevention and treatment, helping stakeholders evaluate long-term health and economic outcomes with greater precision.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
