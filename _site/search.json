    "text": "The Nordic QALY Shortfall Calculator is an interactive RShiny application developed to support health technology assessments (HTAs) across Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. It estimates Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) shortfalls—a key metric for evaluating disease severity and guiding healthcare prioritization. By comparing the quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of individuals with a specific disease to that of the general population, the tool provides transparent, evidence-based insights using national life tables and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data.\nThis project transforms static health economic evaluations into a dynamic, user-driven experience. Built entirely in RShiny, the app integrates validated utility scoring algorithms (e.g., EQ-5D-3L/5L) and applies the Sullivan method to calculate QALE and shortfall metrics. Users can input demographic and clinical parameters, select utility scenarios, and instantly visualize results. The app’s modular design supports flexible scenario comparisons, enabling rapid exploration of severity-based modifiers and their impact on HTA decisions.\nBy making QALY shortfall estimation accessible and interactive, the Nordic QALY Shortfall Calculator empowers researchers, policymakers, and HTA professionals to apply severity-based weighting in a consistent and transparent manner. It facilitates cross-country comparisons, supports methodological harmonization, and encourages data-driven decision-making. The app’s open and adaptable framework also allows for future updates and extensions, making it a valuable resource for ongoing research and policy development in the Nordic region and beyond.\nThe app is built using the Shiny package for R.

    "text": "The MOON (Modeling Obesity in Norway) study is a comprehensive decision-analytic model designed to simulate the long-term health and economic impacts of obesity in the Norwegian population. Built using a Markov framework, the model tracks individuals from age 2 to 100 across health states—normal weight, overweight, obese grade 1, obese grade 2, and death—based on real-world longitudinal data from national health surveys and registries. It estimates prevalence, healthcare costs, and years of life lost due to obesity, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of preventive and treatment interventions.\n\n\nWe are currently undertaking a modernization of the MOON model by transitioning it from its original Excel-based implementation to a more scalable and transparent R-based framework. This shift will involve re-coding the model logic, integrating statistical analyses directly within R, and improving the reproducibility and flexibility of simulations. By leveraging R’s capabilities in data handling, visualization, and probabilistic modeling, we aim to enhance the model’s usability for researchers, policymakers, and public health analysts.\nMigrating the MOON model to R will significantly improve its accessibility, adaptability, and analytical power. The new version will allow for easier updates with new data, more sophisticated scenario analyses, and integration with other public health datasets. It will also enable other researchers—both within and outside Norway—to replicate, calibrate, and extend the model to their own contexts. Ultimately, this upgrade will support more informed decision-making in obesity prevention and treatment, helping stakeholders evaluate long-term health and economic outcomes with greater precision.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Governance and Modernization in Changing Environment (INSEARCH 2018)\nVenue: BARD, Comilla, Bangladesh\nBackground: Previously, studies have manifested a high magnitude of maternal deathsattributed to obstetric haemorrhage in West Bengal. But in the recent decade, the State has marked a unique recognition for having the highest maternal mortality caused by eclampsia in the country as well as in the globe.\nObjectives: The study aimed to determine the incidence of maternal mortality attributed to eclampsia and identify the confounding factors associated with eclamptic maternal deaths.\nMethods: It was a mixed method study. First, a facility-based study was conducted for all maternal deaths occurred between November 2013 and October 2015 (N=317), in two tertiary level hospitals. Second, we conducted community-based maternal death reviews (verbal autopsies) of 20 deaths.\nResults: Eclampsia accounted in one-third of maternal deaths. Almost two-thirds of maternal deaths attributed to eclampsia were highly concentrated among women who resided in distant areas from the studied hospitals. The women belonged to &lt;24 years age group (65%) and primigravidas (40%) mothers were noted to have an increased risk of eclamptic deaths as compared to relatively older groups and multigravida women. The maternal deaths related to eclampsia was comparatively higher among cesarean section experienced mother compared to normally delivered. Verbal autopsies indicated that majority of pregnant women had the irregular AN Cheek-ups history, particularly during the second trimester of pregnancy. Most of the eclamptic deceased women had been taken to at least three health facilities. Gravidity, the number of ANC and mode of delivery were the significant confounder of eclamptic deaths in the study.\nConclusion: The study confirmed an excess risk of hypertensive disorders which is much higher compared to previous studies in the globe. Establishment of separate Eclampsia Units at lower levels health facilities equipping with modern ICU facilities is more plausible and expedient pathway to alleviate the burden of eclampsia-related maternal deaths.\nKeywords: Eclampsia, Maternal Mortality, West Bengal"

    "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction: Poor water quality has been considered to be a confounder factor of the communicable disease. The study analyzed the current burden of communicable diseases and explored the factors associated with it in the major urban populated states of India.\nMethods: This study used the India’s fourth round District Level Household and Facility Survey (2012–13) data. The study particularly focused on the major urban states of India which are having more than 30,000 urban populations. We used bivariate analysis and the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to identify the independent predictors.\nResults: Public tap was found to be a prime source of drinking water in the urban India. Tamil Nadu (near about half) had the largest urban population using unimproved water sources. The prevalence of communicable disease was high (11 percent) among the population using unimproved drinking compared to their counterparts (5 percent). About 15 percent of the urban population in West Bengal had higher communicable diseases than other urban populated states of India. The factors found significantly associated with communicable diseases were age (AOR=1.40), years of schooling (AOR=0.95), source of drinking water (AOR=0.77) and having toilet facility (AOR=1.32).\nConclusion: Improved drinking water coverage in India is still considerably low as compared to the national target set in SDG. The present study suggests that improved drinking water sources and clean and hygienic toilet facility are significant determinants of communicable diseases. The measure should be devised to enhance health information and accessibility of safe drinking water to prevent communicable diseases in line with achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 3.\nKeywords: Communicable diseases, risk factors, urban area, India."
