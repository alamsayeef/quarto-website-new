I am a doctoral candidate at Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim. I have extensive background working with varied health data sets and using advanced analytics to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I advanced my expertise through doctoral research focused on statistical genetics and gastrointestinal diseases, working extensively in R, Python, and bash environments. I also deepened my skills in data visualization, including building interactive Shiny apps. I am passionate about leveraging programming to solve real-world problems in healthcare.
