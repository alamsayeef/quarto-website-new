# Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to:

1. Connect your Git account
2. Set up SSH keys
3. Create a local Git repository
4. Link it to an online repository

# Step 1: Connect Git Account

- Hoping that you have git downloaded and installed if not you can download from [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Configure your Git identity:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

# Step 2: Set Up SSH Keys

* Generate SSH key:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

Press Enter to accept the default file location.

* Start the SSH agent:

```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

* Add your SSH key to the agent:

```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

* Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* Add the key to your Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) under `Settings > SSH > Add new key`.

# Step 3: Create Local Git Repository

Navigate to your project directory:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Initialize Git:

```sh
git init
```

Add files and commit:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

# Step 4: Link to Online Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab (without README if already committed locally).

Link your local repo:

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git
```

Sometimes it maybe `master` or `main`. You can check that by

```sh
git branch
```

Push your code:

```sh
git push -u origin master
```

Here the `-u` parameter means upstream so next time you can just write git push and it will remember that you wish to push it to master. (useful when you have single branch)

After this you only need to repeat the following:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "provide new commit comment"
git push origin master
```
